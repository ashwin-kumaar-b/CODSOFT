# Task 5 – Contact Management System 📇

## ✅ Description
This is a simple command-line Contact Management System built using Python.  
I designed it to let users **add**, **view**, **search**, **update**, and **delete** contacts easily, all from a terminal-based interface.

Each contact stores:
- Name
- Phone number
- Email
- Address

It runs in a loop so users can manage multiple contacts during a single session.

## 🧠 Features

- **Add Contact**: Enter full details of a new contact  
- **View Contacts**: See a list of all saved contacts (name + phone)  
- **Search Contact**: Find a contact by name or phone  
- **Update Contact**: Edit existing contact info  
- **Delete Contact**: Remove a contact completely  
- **Exit**: Ends the program  

All inputs are handled cleanly and feedback is provided after each action.
