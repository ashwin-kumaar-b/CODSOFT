repository for CODSOFT internship



## ðŸ‘‹ Hello!
This repository contains all the tasks I completed as part of my **Python Programming Internship** at **CODSOFT**.

Each task is organized into a separate folder with its own source code and README.  
The goal was to demonstrate core Python concepts through practical mini-projects.
